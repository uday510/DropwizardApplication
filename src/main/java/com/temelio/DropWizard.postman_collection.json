		"description": "# 🚀 Get started here\n\nThis template guides you through CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), variables, and tests.\n\n## 🔖 **How to use this template**\n\n#### **Step 1: Send requests**\n\nRESTful APIs allow you to perform CRUD operations using the POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE HTTP methods.\n\nThis collection contains each of these [request](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/requests/) types. Open each request and click \"Send\" to see what happens.\n\n#### **Step 2: View responses**\n\nObserve the response tab for status code (200 OK), response time, and size.\n\n#### **Step 3: Send new Body data**\n\nUpdate or add new data in \"Body\" in the POST request. Typically, Body data is also used in PUT request.\n\n```\n{\n    \"name\": \"Add your name in the body\"\n}\n\n ```\n\n#### **Step 4: Update the variable**\n\nVariables enable you to store and reuse values in Postman. We have created a [variable](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/) called `base_url` with the sample request [https://postman-api-learner.glitch.me](https://postman-api-learner.glitch.me). Replace it with your API endpoint to customize this collection.\n\n#### **Step 5: Add tests in the \"Tests\" tab**\n\nTests help you confirm that your API is working as expected. You can write test scripts in JavaScript and view the output in the \"Test Results\" tab.\n\n<img src=\"https://content.pstmn.io/b5f280a7-4b09-48ec-857f-0a7ed99d7ef8/U2NyZWVuc2hvdCAyMDIzLTAzLTI3IGF0IDkuNDcuMjggUE0ucG5n\">\n\n## 💪 Pro tips\n\n- Use folders to group related requests and organize the collection.\n- Add more [scripts](https://learning.postman.com/docs/writing-scripts/intro-to-scripts/) in \"Tests\" to verify if the API works as expected and execute workflows.\n    \n\n## 💡Related templates\n\n[API testing basics](https://go.postman.co/redirect/workspace?type=personal&collectionTemplateId=e9a37a28-055b-49cd-8c7e-97494a21eb54&sourceTemplateId=ddb19591-3097-41cf-82af-c84273e56719)  \n[API documentation](https://go.postman.co/redirect/workspace?type=personal&collectionTemplateId=e9c28f47-1253-44af-a2f3-20dce4da1f18&sourceTemplateId=ddb19591-3097-41cf-82af-c84273e56719)  \n[Authorization methods](https://go.postman.co/redirect/workspace?type=personal&collectionTemplateId=31a9a6ed-4cdf-4ced-984c-d12c9aec1c27&sourceTemplateId=ddb19591-3097-41cf-82af-c84273e56719)",

YTB is experiential learning in the interests of building community. YTB introduces youth to principles of co-production and servant leadership. When youth are involved with community, they strengthen their connections to their community and learn about Civic Engagement. As youth continue with YTB they experience co-production -- a model in which each person contributes to the design and delivery of projects or services. YTB's Vision is that all youth transition to adulthood with the experience of contributing service to their community. YTB is a system of service exchange that leverages the talents, capabilities, and energies of youth so that they are viewed as partners and co-producers to achieve shared goals and work towards shared visions in our communities. Youth Earning Time Credits For Community Service Activities - Youth TimeBanking is a nonprofit that provides youth with opportunities through its network of community organizations. YTB is timebanking customized for youth, a program of giving and receiving where youth earn YTB time credits for their service contributions. Youth take care of Little Free Libraries and community gardens, design logos, participate in virtual events, work on anti-bullying projects, and more. YTB time credits can be exchanged for resources or services, such as cell phone minutes, refurbished technology, sports gear, school supplies, arts-crafts supplies, books, coaching sessions, digital inclusion, lessons, etc. YTB is a youth-adult partnership in which youth develop strengths, make community connections, and experience something bigger than themselves.
